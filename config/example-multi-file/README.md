# Multi-file configuration example

Splits one configuration across several files using Zentinel's `include`
directive. Useful when routes, upstreams and listeners are maintained by
different people or change at different rates.

```
example-multi-file/
├── zentinel.kdl          entry point: schema-version, system, limits, includes
├── listeners/
│   ├── http.kdl          plain HTTP listener
│   └── https.kdl         TLS listener
├── upstreams/backends.kdl upstream pools
└── routes/
    ├── api.kdl           /api routes
    └── static.kdl        catch-all route
```

Validate the whole tree:

```bash
zentinel test --config config/example-multi-file/zentinel.kdl
```

## How includes work

- `include "routes/*.kdl"` takes a glob, resolved **relative to the file
  containing the directive**.
- Included files contain ordinary top-level blocks (`routes { … }`,
  `upstreams { … }`), not fragments. They are merged into one configuration,
  so several files may each contribute a `routes` block.
- Includes are expanded recursively, and circular includes are detected and
  rejected.
- A glob matching no files warns rather than failing, so an empty
  `routes/` directory does not break startup.
- `include` only works when loading from a file. Parsing a KDL *string*
  rejects it, since there is no base path to resolve against.

## Ordering

Route matching does not depend on file order: more specific routes win, and
catch-all routes need `priority "low"`. `static.kdl` relies on that rather
than on being included last.
