//! Reports configuration keys that no parser reads.
//!
//! KDL blocks accept any key. A name the parser does not recognise is dropped
//! without complaint, so a misspelling produces no error, no warning, and no
//! effect — the proxy runs on the default while the config file says otherwise.
//! That has cost real behaviour more than once: `max-lifetime-secs` left
//! connection pools with no lifetime cap, and the whole `timeouts` block was
//! discarded in favour of defaults, because in each case the parser read a
//! slightly different name than every config wrote.
//!
//! This check works from the KDL document rather than the parsed `Config`,
//! because by the time a `Config` exists the unknown keys are already gone.
//!
//! # Only closed blocks are checked
//!
//! Some blocks legitimately hold arbitrary keys — a JSON schema's properties,
//! a header map, agent configuration forwarded verbatim. Warning about those
//! would be noise, and noise in a linter is worse than silence because it
//! teaches people to skip the output.
//!
//! So this checks an explicit list of blocks whose key set is known and fixed
//! (`CLOSED_BLOCKS`). Anything not on that list is not inspected. Adding a
//! block to the list is deliberately a decision, and `shipped_configs_use_only_known_keys`
//! guards it: if a real config uses a key the list does not know about, that
//! test fails rather than operators getting a false warning.
//!
